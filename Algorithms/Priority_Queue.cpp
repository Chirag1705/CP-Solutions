By Default C++ creates a max heap for priority queue.

Syntax For Min Heap -> priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> q;

# Great Tip :-
The above syntax may be difficult to remember, so in case of numeric values, we can multiply the values with -1 and use max heap to get the effect of min heap.
